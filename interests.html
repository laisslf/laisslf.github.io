                  <h2>Let's be serious</h2>
                  <p>This exercise is all about who am I as a professional. I've had a nice career so far. It may sound that I'm not taking anything seriously with this cat stuff, but actually, this is pretty serious to me.</p>
                  <p>I need to showcase all I learned during this semester and I used my cats to display some features.</p>

                <h2>My Career</h2>
                <p>I have two bachelor's degree. I graduated in Journalism (Mass Communication) and in Law back in my home country.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of my career, in 2008, ironically, I worked managing websites. I would review the pages, suggest some design to improve the user experience.</p>
                <p>At that period, UX design wasn't a thing, but I did create a few wireframes.</p>
                <p>In 2011, I was working as a marketing planner. I worked directly with the designer to develop some nice live marketing stuff.</p>
                <p>When I was almost finishing Law school, I decided to dedicate myself to become a lawyer. I graduated and acted as a lawyer for a few years.</p>
                <p>Then, I went to work on the Bar Association of my state, as a legal aid and after one year, I assumed the overall management of the organization.</p>
                <p>I never fully returned to marketing and websites, but my skills were in constant use.</p>
                <p>I ended up leading a project to change the whole IT system of the Bar Association. That means that we updated the database, and implemented a web system for lawyers to register and file complaints. That experience was fundamental to ignite my desire to study Computer Programming.</p>
                <p>So, I would say that my set of professional skills were always driven by my diverse interests.</p>

                <h2>My current Interests</h2>
                <p>Nowadays, I'm interested in learning more about databases. I also really enjoy developing websites.</p>
                <p>I think is too early in the program for me to set my field. For now, I'm thinking to learn more about web dev, and also about data science. Let's see in a few months how I'm going to feel about this.</p>
